# PyBounce
## Overview
#### PyBounce is a simple game that uses a bar to keep a ball from falling down. This game is intended for people who are looking for a new game to beat. Although this game is functional it needs to be worked on and add new features to liven up this game, in the future I would like to implement some power-ups to help the user as the levels get harder.

## How Does The Game Work?
#### Once the game has started the user will see a ball appear at the top of their screen. The ball will fall at a constant speed as you move your bar left and right across the screen to make sure the ball doesn't fall down. As you get more points your level will increase leading to a higher difficulty.
