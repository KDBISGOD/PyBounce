## Introduction:
### PyBounce is a simple bar and ball bouncing game where you have to make sure the moving ball doesn't fall under the bar. Then if you miss the bar game ends.

## Controls:
### Left-Arrow = The bar moves toward the left
### Right-Arrow = The bar moves toward the right

## How The Game Works:
### Move the bar side to side to keep the ball, but be aware, every two points the ball's speed increases. See how far you can get in the game.

## Langauge:
### Pybounce has been coded in python
